    "description":"Afrasiyab is the grandson of Tur and son of Pashang and ruler of Turan. (E. Yarshater) Depicted as a tyrant king, he ruled Iran for 12 years and was the provocateur of one of the longest-lasting battles in the Shahnameh between Iran and Turan. Son of Zal and Rudabeh, Rustam is Iran’s national hero. Following his father’s orders, Rustam rescues the 1st king of the Kayanian Dynasty, Kayqubad, and participates in the war of Kayqubad against Afrasiyab. Rustam became the national hero of Iran as he upheld Iran’s integrity against the Turanians. This manuscript scene portrays the climax of the battle between Rustam and Afrasiyab; Rustam successfully as Afrasiyab by the belt and effortlessly lifts him. After what Ferdowsi notes as a “single-mounted combat,” Rustam emerges as the victor and seizes Afrasiyab by the belt. (Abu ʾl-Qasim Firdowsi Tusi) Rustam asserts his dominance and power by successfully capturing and dragging Afrasiyab to his saddle. Not only that, but Rustam manages to embarrass and humiliate the tyrant by effortlessly hoisting him as “if he weighed no more than a mosquito, making his soul worth less than a fistful of dirt.” (University of Cambridge Museums) Seemingly, Ferdowsi further perpetuates Afrasiyab’s humiliation by detailing his pathetic escape. After a series of coincidences, Afrasiyab could escape death and flee as his belt could not tolerate his weight and broke off. With Afrasiyab escaping death and fleeing, Firdausi notes Rustam’s remorse as he laments his inability to incapacitate Afrasiyab. The Shahnama details how Rustam’s oversight would have lasting ramifications throughout the second half of the Shahnama\""},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
