    "description":"Afrasiyab is the grandson of Tur and son of Pashang and ruler of Turan. (E. Yarshater) Depicted as a tyrant king, he ruled Iran for 12 years and was the provocateur of one of the longest-lasting battles in the Shahnameh between Iran and Turan. Son of Zal and Rudabeh, Rustam is Iran’s national hero. Following his father’s orders, Rustam rescues the 1st king of the Kayanian Dynasty, Kayqubad, and participates in the war of Kayqubad against Afrasiyab. Rustam became the national hero of Iran as he upheld Iran’s integrity against the Turanians. This manuscript scene portrays the climax of the battle between Rustam and Afrasiyab; Rustam successfully as Afrasiyab by the belt and effortlessly lifts him. After what Ferdowsi notes as a \"single-mounted combat,\" Rustam emerges as the victor and seizes Afrasiyab by the belt. (Abu ʾl-Qasim Firdowsi Tusi) Rustam asserts his dominance and power by successfully capturing and dragging Afrasiyab to his saddle. Not only that, but Rustam manages to embarrass and humiliate the tyrant by effortlessly hoisting him as \"if he weighed no more than a mosquito, making his soul worth less than a fistful of dirt.\" (University of Cambridge Museums) Seemingly, Ferdowsi further perpetuates Afrasiyab’s humiliation by detailing his pathetic escape. After a series of coincidences, Afrasiyab could escape death and flee as his belt could not tolerate his weight and broke off. With Afrasiyab escaping death and fleeing, Firdausi notes Rustam’s remorse as he laments his inability to incapacitate Afrasiyab. The Shahnama details how Rustam’s oversight would have lasting ramifications throughout the second half of the Shahnama\""},

    "description":"Characterized by his remarkable physical attributes, bravery, and virtue, Rustam represents Iran's most distinguished hero. As Ferdowsi proclaims, Rustam \"develops into a strong lion-like man of such great strength and stature that he has no trouble confronting a roaring elephant and slaying it instantly with his mace.\" (Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis) Illustrated manuscripts ascribe specific attributes to the portrayal of Rustam to enhance his strength and bravery. Illustrated manuscripts further embellished Rustam with a tiger-skin coat and snow-leopard helmet, which also helped differentiate him from other soldiers.(Aga Khan Museum)  Rustam is also, at times, portrayed donning an ox-headed mace and leopard-skin saddle (Ed Eduljee). The manuscripts reflect the poetic metaphors of Rustam through his appearance. While he is clearly human, his clothing is animal print to further embody his physical (Jerome W. Clinton, Marianna S. Simpson). Another intriguing attribute to Rustam's armor and physical attributes is his similarities to Gayumars. Like the first king, Rustam incorporates animal prints into his armor to further exemplify his virtue and strength. While he is clearly human, his clothing is animal print to further embody his physical. Another intriguing attribute to Rustam’s armor and physical attributes is his similarities to Gayumars. Like the first king, Rustam incorporates animal prints into his armor to further exemplify his virtue and strength. Furthermore, Rustam's helmet illustrates the time flow and clarifies where he is within his seven courses (Sword Temple). Manuscripts that show Rustam with a snow-leopard helmet represent the period before the completion of the seven courses and vice-versa (Clinton, Simpson). In this scene, the manuscript portrays Rustam wearing a snow-leopard helmet rather than the white div head. Rustam's snow-leopard helmet implies that this scene transpired earlier in the epic before he satisfied his seven labors.\""},

    "description":"As a war hero, illustrated manuscripts customarily portray Rustam in armed gear and always wearing a helmet. That said, the aesthetic style of the helmet varies with time and manuscript. Fourteenth and early fifteenth-century illustrated manuscripts often portrayed Rustam's helmet as metallic with round ear guards (Michael V. Gorelik ).  One can assume that the artists drew the helmet as metallic to correspond to the \"iron helmet\" described by Firdausi . Conversely, by 1430, Rustam's helmet underwent a significant change and became the snow-leopard head affiliated with Rustam today. By the sixteenth century, the snow-leopard head helmet had become synonymous with Rustam (Sword Temple)  . In this manuscript, Rustam dons a snow-leopard helmet to indicate its affiliation with illustrated manuscripts post-1430. Armor design is crucial to explore as it can reveal the illustrated manuscripts' historical background and cultural context. Eight to Thirteenth-century armor harken back to Sasanian Iran and Byzantine designs through the lamellar armor coats and metallic rounded helmets.  Armor design and function underwent modifications from the mid-thirteenth to mid-fourteenth century through the Mongol conquest. The Mongol conquest brought new influences on the traditional armor, and Mongol-style armor was standard in the early fourteenth century.  The Mongol-style helmets differed vastly with pointed tops, laminated aventails, and ear pierces. Most illustrated manuscripts incorporate Mongol-style armor and highlight the Sino-Mongol influence during this era. (Gorelik )  This manuscript accentuates this by depicting pointy helmets, small round shields, knee guards, and laminated armor with shoulder guards. Furthermore, the manuscript adopts the armbands with a plate covering the upper part of the arm rather than the metal gauntlet armbands to highlight the everchanging armor design and infusion of Mongol culture into Iranian culture.\""},

    "description":"Created around the same time, the Cambridge Manuscript \"No. 7 Rostam lifts Afrasiyab of Turan by the belt\" is formally the most like the Oxford manuscript . Both manuscripts emphasize the altercation between Rustam and Afrasiyab by placing them in the center frame. Other similarities include Rustam's arm lifting upright to place Afrasiyab effortlessly above him. While both manuscripts place opposing soldiers on the respective edge to create a hostile perspective, the number of soldiers and their weapons differ. The Oxford manuscripts soldiers use arrows, compared to the Cambridge manuscript, which depicts the soldiers using the Shamshir (curved Iranian saber) and arrows. (Manouchehr Moshtagh Khorasani)  Seeing how both the manuscripts come from Timurid, Shiraz in a relatively similar period, both possess Mongol-inspired features. From the depiction of the armor to the stylistic choice, the two manuscripts parallel one another. However, the Cambridge manuscript incorporates a Div mask alongside Rustam's snow-leopard helmet to potentially foreshadow Rustam's seven courses. (Sword Temple )  Furthermore, the Cambridge manuscript portrays Rustam with reddish hair - a familiar feature in several other manuscripts but the Oxford version. While Firdawsi's Shahnameh does not document Rustam's red hair, the earliest surviving manuscripts of the Shahnama continue to depict Rustam with red hair. (Peyvand Firouzeh)  The association with showing Rustam with red hair could originate from the medieval Islamic world when red hair was associated with blood and bloodshed and connected with extraordinary physical strength and is the most significant distinction between the Cambridge and oxford manuscripts' portrayal of Rustam.(Firouzeh)\""},

    "description":"The MET manuscript is titled \"Rustam Seizes Afrasiyab by the Girdle and Lifts him from the Saddle\" and is another region's manuscript depicting the battle between Rustam and Afrasiyab.  Created around the same time as the Oxford manuscript, the MET attributed this illustrated manuscript to Northern India . Because of the coinciding date of creation, the two manuscripts share similar aesthetic qualities. These similarities include the Mongol-inspired Iranian armor and pointed helmets. While the armor style and design closely resemble one another, the MET manuscript incorporates fewer vertical patterns and adopts more flat colors. Furthermore, the MET manuscript seems to prioritize the conflict between Iran and Turan over the moment Rustam embarrasses Afrasiyab. The MET manuscript places Rustam and Afrasiyab at the bottom of the page rather than the center. By placing Rustam and Afrasiyab at the bottom, the manuscript prioritizes the soldier's battle, unlike the Oxford illustration, which focuses on the embarrassing moment. (TheMET)  Another feature of the MET manuscript is the lack of iconography that distinguishes Rustam. Most examples of Rustam would incorporate the tiger print armor and snow-leopard helmet to easily differentiate Rustam from other soldiers. The MET manuscript forgoes the snow-leopard helmet; instead, it highlights the tiger skin armor and red hair that distinguishes Rustam from others. Another difference the MET manuscript adopts is the illustration of Rakhsh, Rustam's horse. If the Oxford manuscript blurred Rakhsh's bold description by covering him in armor, the MET manuscript highlights Rakshsh's bold \"mottled red and gold, saffron petaled\" print.(The British Library Board)\""},
